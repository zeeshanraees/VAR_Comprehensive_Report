# VAR_Comprehensive_Report
This report replicates and extends the (VAR) analysis of Stock and Watson (2001) examining the dynamic relationships between inflation, unemployment, and the federal funds rate in the United States. Using quarterly data from 1960 to 2000, we estimate a three-variable VAR model and investigate the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy shocks.
